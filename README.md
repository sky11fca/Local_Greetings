We have all this issue: You want to go out with the boys for a basketball game, but all available sport fields are either not available or already booked from the start.

Wouldn't be nice if there was an uniform platform easy to use for booking sports field?

Our aim is to put an end with finding the perfect field just so that was already taken by somebody else
with our platform, is easy to find non-reserved fields and booking one is simple with only 2 clicks away

(This needs more rewriting)
